Web application that allows users to search for news articles from the New York Times. The application consists of a search field where users can enter keywords related to the news they are interested in, and a gallery that displays the search results.
####
When a user enters a search query and clicks the search button, the application queries the New York Times API and retrieves a list of news articles that match the search criteria. The search results are then displayed in the gallery section of the page, with each article represented as a card that includes the article's title, author, publication date, and a brief summary of the content.
####
The search gallery also includes a "Load More" button that allows users to retrieve additional search results as they scroll down the page.

React New York Times news search gallery project is a great tool for anyone who wants to stay informed about the latest news and events. It provides an easy-to-use interface for searching and browsing news articles from the New York Times.
